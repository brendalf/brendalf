In Netherlands I reside, a Brazilian's grace,<br>
A coder's odyssey in this digital space.<br>
From policing the streets with courage untold,<br>
To scripting new futures in code's manifold.

Workflow's sweet cadence, a quest I pursue,<br>
Bol.com's engineer, crafting anew.<br>
Linux's command, terminal's swift dance,<br>
Neovim and keystrokes, in symphonic trance.

Distributed realms, where systems align,<br>
Machine learning's secrets, forever enshrine.<br>
Languages varied, my toolkit complete,<br>
Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go's heartbeat.

Tutorials unfurled on a personal domain,<br>
Consolidating wisdom, knowledge to gain.<br>
A GitHub story where my journey I pen,<br>
A Brazilian in Netherlands, again and again.
