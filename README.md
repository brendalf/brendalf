<p align="center">
In Netherlands I reside, a Brazilian's grace,<br>
A coder's odyssey in this digital space.<br>
From policing the streets with courage untold,<br>
To scripting new futures in code's manifold.
</p>

<p align="center">
Workflow's sweet cadence, a quest I pursue,<br>
A software engineer, crafting anew.<br>
Linux's command, terminal's swift dance,<br>
Neovim and keystrokes, in symphonic trance.
</p>

<p align="center">
Distributed realms, where systems align,<br>
Machine learning's secrets, forever enshrine.<br>
Languages varied, my toolkit complete,<br>
Python, TypeScript, Rust, Go's heartbeat.
</p>

<p align="center">
Tutorials unfurled on a personal domain,<br>
Consolidating wisdom, knowledge to gain.<br>
A GitHub story where my journey I pen,<br>
Sharing pathways to learn, free from restrain.
</p>

<p align="center">
Like the wizard who's punctual in tales of yore,<br>
I arrive right on time, coding's secrets to explore.<br>
So join me, dear wanderers, on this coding ride,<br>
Together we'll conquer, with passion as our guide.
</p>
